Added support for authentication. #JIRA-123.

## Why?
These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #JIRA-123 for more information.

## How? (Optional)
This includes a migration, model and controller for user authentication. I'm using Devise to do the heavy lifting. I ran Devise migrations and those are included here.
